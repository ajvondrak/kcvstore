This code was tested with Python 2.7.3, and requires the following external
modules, which are available via PyPI (`sudo pip install`):
- blist (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist/1.3.4)
- Flask (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.10.1)

I've been using nose (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/1.3.0) to run my tests,
but it's not a requirement; most of the tests are of the standard unittest
variety.
